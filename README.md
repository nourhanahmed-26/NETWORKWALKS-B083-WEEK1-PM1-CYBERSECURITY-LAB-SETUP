# 🪜 Lab Setup Procedure


## Step 1. Install 7-Zip

7-Zip was installed to extract the Kali Linux virtual-machine package, which may be distributed as a `.7z` archive.

**Tool:** 7-Zip

---

## Step 2. Install VirtualBox

VirtualBox was installed as the hypervisor.

---

## Step 3. Create the NAT Network

A dedicated NAT Network was created in VirtualBox.

Configuration:
Network Name: NatNetwork
IPv4 Prefix:  10.0.0.0/24
DHCP:         Enabled
IPv6:         Disabled

)

A **NAT Network** was selected because multiple virtual machines connected to the same NAT Network can communicate with one another while also having outbound network connectivity.

This will allow future attacker and target VMs to communicate within the lab.


---
## Step 4. Import Kali Linux

The Kali Linux virtual machine was downloaded from the official Kali Linux website and imported into VirtualBox.

The VM network adapter was configured as follows:

)
A shared folder was also configured for transferring required files between the host operating system and the Kali VM.



## 1️⃣ Boot

The VM boots into the standard GRUB menu for Kali GNU/Linux.

)

---

## 2️⃣ Network adapter configuration

Adapter 1 is attached to a **NAT Network** (named `NatNetwork`) rather than plain NAT — this lets the VM reach the internet while keeping the option open to add more VMs to the same virtual network later. Promiscuous Mode is set to **Allow All**.

)
The VM network adapter was configured as follows:

```text
Adapter 1
Attached to: NAT Network
Network:     NatNetwork
Adapter Type: Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop
```
---

## 3️⃣ Verifying the IP address

Desktop after boot, network active ✅:

)

---

## 4️⃣ Taking a snapshot 📸

Once networking was confirmed working, a snapshot was taken to preserve this known-good state before making further changes.

## 📝 Notes

- 🏷️ Snapshot name: `My Fresh Kali Linux after installation`
- 💬 Snapshot description: *"It is working good. I have set the IP address."*
- ⏪ Taking a snapshot here means any future misconfiguration (networking, dependencies, etc.) can be rolled back to this exact point instantly via **Snapshots → Restore** in VirtualBox Manager.
